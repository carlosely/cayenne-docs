<p id="rpi-get-started-in-minutes" class="anchor-link"></p>


### Getting started in minutes!

1. Power on your Raspberry Pi. Connect the power adapter to your Raspberry Pi.
2. Connect the Pi to the Internet. Connect your Raspberry Pi to the Internet using an Ethernet cable. Or, if you have a Wi-Fi dongle setup already this works too.
3. Make sure the Raspbian operating system is installed. Cayenne works with Jessie OS versions of Raspbian. Please make sure one of these is pre-installed to the sd card. If you need to install the Raspbian operating system, <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/" target="_blank">click here</a>.

   **Note:** You do not need to make any configuration changes to the Pi device. Cayenne automatically handles setting up and configuring your Pi for use. However, it is recommended that you expand the filesystem on the flash card if necessary. Please refer to raspi-config if you need additional information on performing this step.

### Get started in minutes!
<p style="text-align:center"><iframe width="480" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hmIGRrvevCA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

Before you can manage your Arduino device using the online dashboard, you must setup your device and install the Cayenne Arduino Library onto the device.

<p id="arduino-setup" class="anchor-link"></p>


### Arduino Setup

Begin by verifying that your Arduino board and PC/Mac are correctly set up before continuing.

<p style="text-align:center"><br/><img src="http://d1nocd4j7qtmw4.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/20160616134313/1st-Experience-Arduino-Step-2-setup-arduino.png" width="600" height="384" alt="Step 2 Arduino"></p>


#### Connect the Arduino to the Internet

Make sure your Arduino is connected to the Internet. On most Arduino boards, you will need to connect an [Ethernet or Wi-Fi shield](#supported-hardware-microcontrollers-arduino-arduino-ethernet-wifi-shield) in order to connect your board to the Internet. Verify that you have a shield supported by Cayenne installed and working.
   
#### Connect the Arduino to a PC/Mac

Power on your Arduino by connecting your Arduino with a USB cable (or FTDI connector if you’re using an Arduino pro). You should see the power LED lit on your board.

*TIP: If you will have more than a couple of sensors attached to your Arduino, it may be a good idea to also supply power to the Arduino using the external power jack. This will ensure that after your board is programmed and running, it has sufficient power for all your connected devices.*

<p id="using-cayenne-library" class="anchor-link"></p>


#### Using Cayenne Arduino Library

The Cayenne Arduino Library is a collection of code, known as sketch files, that makes it easy for you to connect and send data to and from sensors, actuators and devices connected to Arduino boards. Cayenne sketch files can be combined with other sketch files for your IoT projects. In this section we will walk you through installing and configuring the Arduino IDE to use the library.

<p id="installing-library-arduino-ide" class="anchor-link"></p>


##### Installing Arduino IDE Software
To use the Cayenne Arduino Library, the Arduino IDE software should be installed. Go to <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software" target="_blank">https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software</a> to download and install the Arduino IDE software if you need it. Arduino IDE can be installed on Windows, Mac or Linux computers.


##### Add Cayenne Library to Arduino IDE

The Cayenne Library is a collection of code, known as sketch files, that makes it easy for you to connect and send data to and from sensors, actuators and devices connected to Arduino boards. Cayenne sketch files can be combined with other sketch files for your IoT projects.

The Cayenne Library is available directly from the Arduino IDE Libraries list. To install the library, select **Sketch** > **Include library** > **Manage Libraries**. The *Library Manager* dialog will appear. From here, search for the **Cayenne** library and install it.

<p style="text-align:center"><br/><img src="http://www.mydevices.com/cayenne/uploads/arduino-ide-manage-libraries.png" width="660" height="552" alt="arduino-ide-manage-libraries"><br/><br/></p>

**Congrats! You are all set! Now your hardware is connected to the Cayenne Cloud!**

If you run into any troubles, see [Troubleshooting](#getting-started-arduino-troubleshooting) for things to check.

<p id="sensors-arduino" class="anchor-link"></p>


### Sensors

Cayenne works with any sensor that is connected to an Arduino. We’ve created <a href="https://github.com/myDevicesIoT/CayenneArduinoSamples" target="_blank">sketch files</a> for the various temperature, luminosity, pressure, proximity, motion and generic sensor models.

**EXAMPLE:** Let’s add temperature sensor TMP36 to see how easy it is.

Connect the TMP36 as shown here. [View TMP36 hardware tutorial](#supported-hardware-sensors-temperature-tmp36-arduino-tutorial)

<p style="text-align:center"><br/><img src="http://d1nocd4j7qtmw4.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/20160601121144/Arduino_TMP36_step3_bb.png" width="600" height="380" alt="Arduino TMP36 Step 3"></p>

Click **Add New** > **Device / Widget**.

<p style="text-align:center"><br/><img src="http://d1nocd4j7qtmw4.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/20160601122359/AddNew.jpg" width="260" height="252" alt="Add New Device"></p>

1. Choose **Sensor** > **Temperature** > **TMP36**.
2. Choose **Virtual** from the I/O field.
3. We will use Virtual Pin 1 for this example. Choose **V1** from the **Pin** field.
4. Click the **Step 1: Sketch File** button to view the sketch file.

<p style="text-align:center"><br/><img src="http://d1nocd4j7qtmw4.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/20160617103706/Add-Device-Arduino-TMP361.png" width="600" height="365" alt="Arduino Add Device TMP361"></p>

A popup will appear showing the TMP36 sketch file. Copy the sketch file contents to the clipboard and open Arduino IDE.

<p style="text-align:center"><br/><img src="http://d1nocd4j7qtmw4.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/20160617151040/Add-Device-Arduino-TMP36-Sketch-file2.png" width="600" height="386" alt="Arduino Add Device TMP361 Sketch File"></p>

Paste the TMP36 sketch file code into the Arduino IDE. After copying & pasting the example sketch files, you will want to double check that your **authentication token** is correct as well as update any pin assignments that appear in the sketch file. [Read more about using sketch files](#sketch-files-using-sketch-files)

In this case, we are using the default Virtual Pin 1 which is already defined in the sketch file, so the sketch file should be OK to use as is. After verifying the sketch file looks good, select **Sketch** > **Upload** to upload the sketch file to your device.

<p style="text-align:center"><br/><img src="http://d1nocd4j7qtmw4.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/20160603151539/TMP36-ArduinoIDE.jpg" width="600" height="836" alt="Arduino IDE TMP361"></p>

In the Cayenne dashboard, you can now click the **Step 2: Add Sensor** button and the TMP36 widget will be added to your dashboard. You can change widget type and settings by clicking on the cogwheel icon in the top right corner of the TMP36 widget.

<p style="text-align:center"><br/><img src="http://d1nocd4j7qtmw4.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/20160601131032/Arduino-TMP36.jpg" width="600" height="336" alt="Arduino IDE TMP361"></p>

<p id="actuators-arduino" class="anchor-link"></p>


### Actuators

Cayenne works with actuators that are connected to an Arduino.  We’ve created <a href="https://github.com/myDevicesIoT/CayenneArduinoSamples/tree/master/Actuators" target="_blank">sketch files</a> for light, motor, valve, relay and generic actuators.

**EXAMPLE:** Let’s add a luminosity actuator widget.

For this example, attach a LED to a PWM-enabled Pin on your Arduino Uno. Let’s use D6 in this example. [View Luminosity hardware tutorial](#supported-hardware-actuators-light-luminosity-arduino-tutorial)

<p style="text-align:center"><br/><img src="http://d1nocd4j7qtmw4.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/20160601112652/Arduino-Luminosity-Step-2.png" width="600" height="307" alt="Arduino Luminosity Step 2"></p>

Click **Add New** > **Device / Widget**.

<p style="text-align:center"><br/><img src="http://d1nocd4j7qtmw4.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/20160601122359/AddNew.jpg" width="260" height="252" alt="Add New Device"></p>

1. Choose **Actuator** > **Light** > **Luminosity**.
2. Choose **Virtual** from the I/O field.
3. We will use Virtual Pin 1 for this example. Choose **V1** from the **Pin field**.
4. Click the **Step 1: Sketch File** button to view the sketch file.

<p style="text-align:center"><br/><img src="http://d1nocd4j7qtmw4.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/20160617110431/Add-Device-Arduino-Luminosity.png" width="600" height="364" alt="Arduino Luminosity Add Device"></p>

A popup will appear showing the Luminosity sketch file. Copy the sketch file contents to the clipboard and open Arduino IDE.

<p style="text-align:center"><br/><img src="http://d1nocd4j7qtmw4.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/20160617152613/Add-Device-Arduino-Luminosity-sketch-file2.png" width="600" height="386" alt="Arduino Luminosity Sketch File"></p>

Paste the Luminosity sketch file code into the Arduino IDE. After copying & pasting the example sketch files, you will want to double check that your **authentication token** is correct as well as update any pin assignments that appear in the sketch file. [Read more about using sketch files](#sketch-files-using-sketch-files)

In this case, the example sketch file assumes that we used Digital Pin 3 to connect our Luminosity actuator, but we used Digital Pin 6 instead. We will need to update the sketch file to correct the pin. Find and update the **LED_DIGITAL_PIN** definition so that it points at pin 6.

```
#define LED_DIGITAL_PIN 6
```

After verifying the sketch file looks good, select **Sketch** > **Upload** to upload the sketch file to your device.

<p style="text-align:center"><br/><img src="http://d1nocd4j7qtmw4.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/20160617151924/Arduino-Luminosity-in-Arduino-IDE.png" width="600" height="554" alt="Arduino Luminosity in Arduino IDE"></p>

In the Cayenne dashboard, you can now click the **Step 2: Add Actuator** button and the luminosity widget will be added to your dashboard. You can now use the slider to control the brightness of the LED.

<p style="text-align:center"><br/><img src="http://d1nocd4j7qtmw4.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/20160601131732/Arduino1stExperience-Luminosity.jpg" width="600" height="376" alt="Arduino Luminosity"></p>

<p id="add-custom-widgets-arduino" class="anchor-link"></p>


### Custom widgets

We’ve integrated some specific sensors and actuators, but there are thousands of sensors, actuators and other devices that get connected to Arduino boards. Custom widgets allow you to send and receive data from any device that is connected to your Arduino board to Cayenne.

[Cayenne Custom Widgets Documentation](#custom-widgets)

**EXAMPLE:** Let’s see how easy it is to use a Custom Widget in Cayenne. We will switch on an LED connected to your Raspberry Pi using a custom Button widget.

Connect an LED to Digital Pin 8 as shown here. [View light switch tutorial](http://www.cayenne-mydevices.com/CayenneStaging/docs#arduino-light-switch)

<p style="text-align:center"><br/><img src="http://d1nocd4j7qtmw4.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/20160601105118/Arduino_LED_step2_bb.png" width="600" height="317" alt="Arduino LED Step 2"></p>

### Troubleshooting

If you don’t see your Arduino device connected to Cayenne, or if you’re running into trouble successfully programming your Arduino with the Arduino IDE, here are a few things to check.

1. **Make sure your Arduino is connected to the Internet**

   On most Arduino boards, you will need to connect an Ethernet or Wi-Fi shield in order to connect your board to the Internet. Verify that you have [a shield supported by Cayenne](#supported-hardware-microcontrollers-arduino-arduino-ethernet-wifi-shield) installed and working.

   *TIP: Double check that the board connection #include in your sketch file is correct for the shield that you are using. The Cayenne sketch file examples assume that you have a W5100 connected. If this line does not match your connection, your board will fail to connect to Cayenne.*
      
   ```
   #include <CayenneEthernet.h>
  
   ```
   <br/>
2. **Make sure your Arduino is connected to a PC/Mac via the USB cable**

   Power on your Arduino by connecting your Arduino with a USB cable (or FTDI connector if you’re using an Arduino pro). You should see the power LED lit on your board.

3. **Configure the Arduino IDE**

   First, verify that you have the <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software" target="_blank">Arduino IDE</a> installed.

   Open the Arduino IDE program and verify that the correct **Board** is selected.

   <p style="text-align:center"><br/><img src="http://d1nocd4j7qtmw4.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/20160616113931/Arduino-IDE-board-selection.png" width="600" height="501" alt="Arduino IDE Board Selection"></p>

   Next, verify that you have the correct **Port** selected for communicating with your Arduino. Pick the correct port based upon how you are connecting your Arduino to your PC/Mac.

4. **Verify that you have the Cayenne Library installed**

   Verify that you see the Cayenne library installed under **File** > **Examples** > **Cayenne**. If you do not, make sure to add it to your Library. For more help on this, see [Add Cayenne Library to Arduino IDE](#getting-started-arduino-arduino-setup-using-cayenne-arduino-library-add-cayenne-library-to-arduino-ide).

5. **Verify that your Arduino is connected with Cayenne**

   You can use the Serial Monitor tool in the Arduino IDE to view some connection information. After uploading your sketch file to the Arduino device, open the **Serial Monitor** and look for the Cayenne connection.

   In the output of the Serial Monitor, you should see something like this:

   ```
   Getting IP...
   My IP: 192.168.0.10
   Connecting to arduino.mydevices.com:8442
   Ready (ping: 109ms).
   ```
   If you don’t, this means your board is not connected to the Internet to send data to the Cayenne cloud. You will need to verify that your Arduino is connected to the Internet. If you don’t see any outptut in the Serial Monitor, leave it open and Reset your Arduino board.


## LoRa®

Before you can manage your LoRa technology device using the online dashboard, you must make sure your device is setup and add it to your Cayenne dashboard.

### LoRaWAN™ setup

Begin by verifying that you have your LoRa network provider account and device information handy, and verify that the hardware is connected to a LoRaWAN gateway in case you are using a private LoRa network (not needed for public LoRaWAN network).

**1\. Make sure your device is powered on and connected**

Your LoRa devices will need to already be connected to either a public or private LoRaWAN network. Contact your network provider if you need help verifying your connection status.

In case of public LoRaWAN network, make sure your devices are powered on and the LoRaWAN coverage of your public network provider is available where you want to use your devices. If you are using a private network, make sure the gateway you will be using is configured and your devices are powered on.

Need a gateway? Here are some helpful links to purchasing and configuring a gateway based on which network you’ll be using.

*   [Setup gateway with Loriot](#lora-loriot-network-setup-gateway-device)
*   [Setup gateway with Senet](#lora-senet-network-setup-gateway-device)
*   [Setup gateway with OrbiWise](#lora-orbiwise-network-setup-gateway-device)


**2\. Make sure you have your LoRaWAN account information**

If your device has not been previously registered with your LoRaWAN network provider, you will need to provide your account information for the chosen LoRa network. You will only need to enter this information once for each network provider used.

Need an account? Here are some helpful links to creating an account based on which network you’ll be using.

*   [Creating Senet account](#lora-senet-network-create-account)
*   [Creating OrbiWise account](#lora-orbiwise-network-create-account)


**3\. Make sure you have the information on your devices being connected**

In order to connect Cayenne to your LoRa technology device, you will need to know the DEVEUI for your device. [What’s this?](#lora-about-deveuis)

In addition to adding previously activated devices, Cayenne is capable of activating new devices on some LoRaWAN provider networks. If you will be activating your device on the network for the first time, you will also need additional information for the activation process, such as your Appkey or AppEUI. The information required will depend upon which activation mode you select for your device and which network you will be using.

### Add LoRa technology device

To begin the process of adding a LoRa device to Cayenne, select the LoRa option from the list of devices. A list of LoRaWAN Networks and supported devices will appear.

<p style="text-align:center"><br/><img src="http://www.mydevices.com/cayenne/uploads/step-1-choose-device-category-2.png" width="600" height="359" alt="step-1-choose-device-category"><br/><br/></p>

<p style="text-align:center"><br/><img src="http://www.mydevices.com/cayenne/uploads/LoRa-Choose-Network-and-Device.png" width="600" height="363" alt="Add LoRa Device"></p>

After selecting the LoRaWAN Network and Device that you want to add, you will then enter in the required settings for adding and activating the LoRa device. Once completed, your dashboard will automatically appear and Cayenne will automatically add widgets for all sensors on your device.
