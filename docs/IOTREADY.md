## Submitting hardware requests

In order for your hardware to be included with Cayenne, you will need to submit a request. The Cayenne team will then review the information and test that the hardware is working with Cayenne. Once everything is approved and tested, your hardware will then be shown to all Cayenne users so that they can make use of it in their IoT products.

*TIP: After submitting a request, you can always [view past submissions](#iot-ready-program-viewing-submissions) from your account and see the current status of your submission.*

### Submission Process Overview

Regardless of which type of device you are submitting, the hardware submission and approval process is the same. Here’s what you can expect at each step of the process:

1. **Submission.** During this phase you’ll need to follow the [Hardware Submission Form](#iot-ready-program-submitting-hardware-requests-hardware-submission-form) which will walk you through providing all required device information to the myDevices team. You will also need to [send test hardware](#iot-ready-program-submitting-hardware-requests-sending-hardware-for-validation) to the myDevices team for validating connection to Cayenne.
2. **Reviewal.** During this phase the myDevices team will review that we have all the information needed for listing your Company and product in the dashboard. Once your test hardware is received, the team will test to verify it is working with Cayenne and is ready to be integrated.

 - **Verifying Company and Hardware information.** The myDevices team will verify that we have all required Company information as well as well information on the hardware to be integrated. If needed, you may be contacted by a member of the team for clarification or questions on supporting your device.
 - **Verification and testing of hardware.** Before your device can be integrated, testing will be performed to verify that the device is working properly with Cayenne. Submitting test hardware for verification is required as a part of the submission process. Be sure to have your hardware delivered promptly to the Cayenne team in order to minimize any delays in the approval process.
 - **Integration and operational testing.** The Cayenne team will start preparing to list your Company and product on the myDevices website and the Cayenne dashboard.
3. **Approval and Live.** After final verification from the myDevices and Cayenne teams, your device will then be made live. Users will then be able to select your hardware directly from the Cayenne dashboard.

### Starting A New Submission

#### Setup and Configuration

On the *Setup and Configuration* page you will enter in some technical information on the hardware and configuration. This information will be used by the Cayenne team when the device is being tested and added into Cayenne.

_TIP: During the process you may leave certain portions here unanswered (such as using the **Unknown** option) if that information is not available or not applicable. The goal for the Setup and Configuration section is to provide enough information to the Cayenne team that they can understand how the device works and so that they can verify it working with Cayenne. These are the same questions that our team would want answered before they implemented such a device themselves._

The type of information asked for here will depend upon how your device will connect to Cayenne.

- [LoRa technology device](#iot-ready-program-submitting-hardware-requests-hardware-submission-form-setup-and-configuration-lora-technology-device): Start a new hardware submission for a device that uses LoRa technology.
- [Device using MQTT](#iot-ready-program-submitting-hardware-requests-hardware-submission-form-setup-and-configuration-mqtt): Start a new hardware submission for a device that will communicate with Cayenne using [MQTT](https://developers.mydevices.com/cayenne/docs/cayenne-mqtt-api/), including Cayenne’s [Bring Your Own Thing API](https://developers.mydevices.com/cayenne/docs/cayenne-mqtt-api/).

##### LoRa technology device

<p style="text-align:center"><br/><img src="http://cloudfront-mydevices-wordpress.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/20170224132026/iot-ready-program-hardware-submission-step-3-setup-and-config-lora-device.png" width="660" height="416" alt="Setup & Config screen showing LoRa fields"><br/><br/></p>

- **Support LoRaWAN™ Bands:** Select which LoRaWAN band frequencies supported by your device.
- **Device Unique Identifier:** Select whether your device supports a user-configurable [DevEUI](https://developers.mydevices.com/cayenne/docs/lora/#lora-about-deveuis). Certain development (e.g. prototype) devices will be configurable, meaning you can modify the device’s unique identifier. If the end user cannot do so, select the **Factory Set** option.
- **LoRaWAN™ Activation:** Specify how your device connects to the LoRa network server.
- **Available Configuration Apps:** If the device uses an app to program or configure the device, please enter in information on the platforms and programs used to do so.
- **Sensor Data Types:** (If your device has embedded sensors) From the list of supported data types shown, select the list of data types that the device sends. By default you will see a list of the most commonly used data types. If you want the full list, click on the **All** link to view them all. To make finding data types easier, you can easily search for data types here.

<p style="text-align:center"><br/><img src="http://cloudfront-mydevices-wordpress.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/20170224132221/iot-ready-program-hardware-submission-step-3.5-embedded-sensors-highlight.png" width="660" height="423" alt="Example Sensor Data Types"><br/><br/></p>

###### Payload Codecs

- **Payload Codecs:** Select what payload format that your device uses to communicate its data. Cayenne needs to know which codec to use to properly decode and encode communication to and from your LoRa technology device.

  <p style="text-align:center"><br/><img src="http://cloudfront-mydevices-wordpress.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/20170224132307/iot-ready-program-hardware-submission-step-3.5-lora-payload-codec-highlight.png" width="660" height="506" alt="Examples of existing codecs"><br/><br/></p>

From the available list of codecs, choose one:

- **Cayenne LPP:** Select this option if your device will use Cayenne’s own [generic Low Power Payload](https://developers.mydevices.com/cayenne/docs/lora/#lora-cayenne-low-power-payload).

  *TIP: We strongly recommend that you use Cayenne’s own LPP as it is the easiest way to get your LoRa technology device integrated with Cayenne. You can find all the information you need for using this payload in [Cayenne Low Power Payload](https://developers.mydevices.com/cayenne/docs/lora/#lora-cayenne-low-power-payload).*

- **One of our already supported codecs:** If Cayenne already includes a codec for your payload format, you can select it from the list of available codecs.
- **Use your own payload format**: If Cayenne does not currently support your device’s payload, select the **Custom** option. After doing so, you will be need to upload documentation that fully describes your payload format. The Cayenne team will then use this information to implement a payload codec that supports your format in Cayenne.

  <p style="text-align:center"><br/><img src="http://cloudfront-mydevices-wordpress.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/20170224132421/iot-ready-program-hardware-submission-step-3.5-custom-payload-highlight.png" width="660" height="271" alt="Custom codec and upload fields"><br/><br/></p>

- **Sample Code Library:** Please specify the location (such as GitHub repository link) to where we can find sample code for connecting the device. It should give the user everything that they need to quickly and easily connect the device with Cayenne using MQTT.

  *TIP: Because the device will use MQTT, you can refer to our [Bring Your Own Thing API](https://developers.mydevices.com/cayenne/docs/cayenne-mqtt-api/) which gives you all the information you need to test connecting your device directly with Cayenne. Using the BYOT API and MQTT, you can easily verify your hardware is working with Cayenne prior to submitting your hardware request!*

  *Note: The code you provide will be displayed directly to the user in a popup window when they click on the example code button shown when adding your device in the Cayenne UI. This example code should be something that a user can copy & paste and use to easily connect that device to Cayenne.*

  <p style="text-align:center"><br/><img src="https://d1nocd4j7qtmw4.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/20160617151040/Add-Device-Arduino-TMP36-Sketch-file2.png" width="660" height="424" alt="Example code popup in Cayenne"><br/><br/></p>
