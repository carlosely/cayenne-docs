## Cayenne Arduino Library

This library contains sketch files for microcontrollers which sends data to and from the Arduino hardware and Cayenne cloud for implementing incoming and outgoing commands, actions, triggers and alerts.

## Bring Your Own Thing Libraries

The Cayenne BYOT API is used to connect your custom board with the Cayenne Cloud. After writing code to connect your board, you can send data from your device to the Cayenne dashboard and display it using widgets. You may also receive commands from Cayenne, allowing remote control and automation of your devices. The BYOT API currently supports MQTT in a variety of languages.
